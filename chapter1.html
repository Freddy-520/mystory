  <h1>Chapter 1: About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is <strong>Freddy</strong>, and my full name in Chinese is <strong>Wang Zhenglin</strong>. I was born in the 2000s in China, in an ordinary family with ordinary beginnings. This is my space to share the moments that have shaped me.</p>

  <p>I created this website as a personal project, not for fame or profit, but simply to <em>document my life</em>, my thoughts, my memories, and my growth. You could say this is something like a digital autobiography — a collection of fragments that define who I am and who I want to become.</p>

  <p>Through these pages, I will talk about my childhood, my values, the people I've met, the lessons I've learned, and the hopes I hold for the future. Writing has always helped me understand myself better — and maybe, someone else might find a piece of themselves in my words too.</p>

  <p>Welcome to my story. This is where it begins.</p>
